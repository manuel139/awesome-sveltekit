<!-- Make sure you're adding new sites to sites.yml, not readme.md.
The readme site list is auto-generated from the data in sites.yml.

If your new site adds a tool/language/package to the uses: [...] field that's
not already used by another site, make sure you add a link to it at the bottom
of readme.md.

Add <put new site url, remove if not adding a site>
